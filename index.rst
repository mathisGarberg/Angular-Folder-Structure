Angular Folder Structure
========================

Based on best practices from the community, other github Angular projects,
developer experience from production Angular projects, and contributors,
this project goal is to create a skeleton structure which is
flexible for projects big or small.

This project defines directory structure in an Angular application
and it is a working application.  The code for this project can be found at
`https://github.com/mathisGarberg/angular-folder-structure <https://github.com/mathisGarberg/angular-folder-structure>`_

Directory Tree Structure
------------------------

This tree represents the directories this repository proposes be added to a
default Angular application::

  .
  ├── media
  └── src
      ├── app
      │   ├── core
      │   ├── data
      │   ├── layout
      │   ├── modules
      │   └── shared
      └── styles

Each part of this tree is optional so please read through the Directory
Structure Parts carefully to understand them all.
